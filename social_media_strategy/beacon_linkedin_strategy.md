üí≠ INSIGHT: Why technology is revolutionizing survivor support in Ghana

After 18 months of operating Ghana's first AI-powered survivor support app, we've learned something crucial: technology doesn't replace human care - it amplifies it.

Key findings:
üìä 73% of survivors prefer anonymous initial contact
üïê Average response time reduced from 48 hours to 2 hours
üéØ AI matching improves resource relevance by 85%
üì± Mobile-first design increases access for younger survivors

The lesson? When we build technology WITH survivors rather than FOR them, we create tools that truly empower.

Our next innovation: Predictive analytics to identify at-risk situations before they escalate. Because prevention is the ultimate protection.

What technologies are you seeing make impact in social work?
