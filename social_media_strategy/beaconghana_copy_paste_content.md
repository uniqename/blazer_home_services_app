💡 TUESDAY WISDOM: Know Your Rights in Ghana

Every person has the right to:
✅ Live free from violence and abuse
✅ Safe housing and shelter
✅ Legal protection and advocacy
✅ Healthcare and mental health support
✅ Education and economic opportunities

These aren't privileges - they're human rights. 

Know your worth. Know your rights. Know you deserve respect.

If you or someone you know needs help:
📞 Crisis Line: +233 50 123 4567
📱 Anonymous app support available

Create a safety plan BEFORE you need it:

🏠 Identify safe places you can go quickly
📞 Memorize important phone numbers
💼 Keep important documents accessible

Your safety matters. Your life has value. Your future holds hope.

### Day 7 (Sunday 6:00 PM) - Hope & Reflection
```
🙏 SUNDAY REFLECTION

"Healing is not linear. Some days you'll feel strong, some days you'll need to rest. Both are part of your journey."

This week's affirmation:
"I honor my pace. I trust my process. I celebrate small victories."

Small victories worth celebrating:
✨ Getting out of bed on a hard day
✨ Asking for help when needed
✨ Setting one small boundary
✨ Taking care of yourself
✨ Still being here, still trying

Your courage to seek help IS a victory. 
Your choice to keep going IS strength.
You ARE enough, exactly as you are. 💜
