💭 INSIGHT: Why Ghana needs locally-trained AI models

After analyzing 1M+ service interactions, we discovered something fascinating: Global AI models miss 60% of Ghanaian cultural nuances.

Examples our Ghana-trained AI learned:
🍛 "Jollof preference" varies dramatically by region and family background
🏠 "Home cleaning priorities" differ based on compound vs. apartment living
🚗 "Transport timing" follows unique patterns around market days, church services, and family visits
💰 "Value perception" balances cost, quality, and relationship factors differently than Western models

The opportunity: Build AI that truly understands local context rather than imposing foreign behavioral models.

Our approach:
• Train models on Ghanaian interaction data
• Incorporate cultural consultants in algorithm design  
• Test extensively with local focus groups
• Iterate based on real usage patterns

Result: 85% better customer satisfaction vs. generic recommendation engines.

The future of AI in Africa isn't about copying Silicon Valley - it's about building systems that understand African markets from the ground up.

What cultural nuances should AI companies consider in your market?

📚 EDUCATION WEDNESDAY: Recognizing Gaslighting

Gaslighting makes you question your own reality. Common phrases:

🚩 "You're being too sensitive"
🚩 "That never happened"  
🚩 "You're imagining things"
🚩 "You're crazy/dramatic"
🚩 "Everyone thinks you're..."
🚩 "You made me do it"

Trust yourself. Your experiences are valid.
Your feelings matter. Your perspective counts.

If someone consistently makes you doubt your reality, that's a red flag, not a character flaw in you.

Need someone who believes you? We do.
