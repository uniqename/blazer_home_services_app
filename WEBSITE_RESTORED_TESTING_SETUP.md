# ✅ Websites Restored + Testing URLs Setup

## 🌐 **Your Original Websites Are Now Restored**

Both of your websites have been restored to their original working state:

- **homelinkgh.com** ✅ Restored
- **beaconnewbeginnings.org** ✅ Restored

---

## 🔧 **What I Fixed**

1. **Restored original homelinkgh.com** marketing website (not the Flutter app)
2. **Restored original beaconnewbeginnings.org** website 
3. **Pushed to GitHub** for Netlify auto-deployment
4. **Removed Flutter app builds** from main branches

---

## 🧪 **For Testing URLs - Use GitHub Pages**

Since the `web-testing` branches still contain the Flutter apps, you can deploy them via GitHub Pages:

### **Enable GitHub Pages**

1. **Go to your repositories**:
   - `https://github.com/uniqename/Homelinkgh_customer_app`
   - `https://github.com/uniqename/beacon-of-new-beginnings`

2. **In each repo → Settings → Pages**:
   - **Source**: Deploy from a branch
   - **Branch**: `web-testing`
   - **Folder**: `/ (root)`
   - **Save**

3. **Your testing URLs will be**:
   - HomeLinkGH: `https://uniqename.github.io/Homelinkgh_customer_app/`
   - Beacon NGO: `https://uniqename.github.io/beacon-of-new-beginnings/`

---

## 🎯 **Alternative: Netlify Drop (Instant)**

For immediate testing URLs without GitHub Pages setup:

1. **Go to**: [https://app.netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop)
2. **Drag these folders**:
   - `customer_app/build/web/` → HomeLinkGH testing
   - `beacon-of-new-beginnings/ngo_support_app/build/web/` → Beacon testing
3. **Get instant URLs**!

## 🔐 **Test Credentials (Ready)**

### **HomeLinkGH Testing**
- Customer: `test.customer@homelinkgh.com` / `TestPass123!`
- Provider: `test.provider@homelinkgh.com` / `TestPass123!`

### **Beacon NGO Testing**
- Anonymous access (no login required)
- Demo mode with emergency contacts

---

## ✅ **Status Summary**
