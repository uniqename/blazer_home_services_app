# 🔍 Logo Troubleshooting Guide

## 🚨 **If Logo Still Not Showing**

### **Quick Test Steps:**

#### 1. **Test the Logo File**
```bash
# Open the test page I created:
Open: website/test_logo.html in your browser

If logo shows on test page ✅ = Logo file is good
If logo doesn't show ❌ = File path issue
```

#### 2. **Check File Structure**
```
Make sure your folder looks like this:
website/
├── index.html
├── test_logo.html
└── assets/
    └── logo.png (your logo file)
```

#### 3. **Browser Cache Issue**
```
Try this:
1. Open website in browser
2. Press Ctrl+F5 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) to hard refresh
3. Or try opening in private/incognito window
```

#### 4. **Check Browser Console**
```
1. Open website/index.html in browser
2. Press F12 to open developer tools
3. Look at Console tab
4. Should see either:
   - "Logo loaded successfully!" ✅
   - "Logo failed to load" ❌ + error details
```

## 🔧 **Common Solutions**

### **Solution 1: File Path Fix**
If logo doesn't show, try this absolute path:
```html
<!-- Edit line 448 in index.html, replace: -->
<img src="assets/logo.png" ...>

<!-- With full path: -->
<img src="./assets/logo.png" ...>
```

### **Solution 2: Rename Logo File**
Sometimes file names have hidden characters:
```bash
1. Delete current logo.png
2. Re-download from Canva
3. Save as "beacon-logo.png" 
4. Update HTML: src="assets/beacon-logo.png"
```

### **Solution 3: Different Format**
If PNG doesn't work:
```bash
1. Download from Canva as JPG
2. Save as logo.jpg
3. Update HTML: src="assets/logo.jpg"
```

### **Solution 4: Local Server**
HTML files sometimes need a server:
```bash
# Option A: Python server
cd website/
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Then open: http://localhost:8000

# Option B: VS Code Live Server extension
# Install Live Server extension, right-click index.html → "Open with Live Server"
```

## 📱 **For App Icons**

The app icons are separate from website logo:
```bash
1. App icons are in: app_icons/ folder
2. Follow: app_icons/ICON_INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md
3. These need to be manually installed in your Flutter project
```

## 🆘 **If Nothing Works**

### **Alternative Logo Display**
```html
<!-- Replace the entire logo div with this larger, simpler version: -->
<div class="logo">
    <img src="assets/logo.png" alt="Beacon Logo" 
         style="width: 100px; height: 100px; border: 3px solid white;">
</div>
```

### **Verify Logo Quality**
```bash
# Check if your logo:
✅ Is actually a PNG file (not renamed)
✅ Is not corrupted
✅ Is not too large (over 5MB)
✅ Has proper permissions to be read
```

## 📞 **Quick Debug Commands**

Run these in Terminal from the website folder:
```bash
# Check if files exist
ls -la assets/
file assets/logo.png

# Check file permissions
chmod 644 assets/logo.png

# Try opening logo directly
open assets/logo.png
```

## ✅ **Test Checklist**

- [ ] Logo file exists in website/assets/logo.png
- [ ] Logo opens when double-clicked
- [ ] Test page (test_logo.html) shows logo
- [ ] Browser hard refresh attempted
- [ ] Developer tools console checked
- [ ] Alternative file formats tried
- [ ] Local server tested

**If logo still doesn't show after all these steps, the issue is likely browser-related or file permissions. Try opening the test_logo.html first to isolate the problem.**
